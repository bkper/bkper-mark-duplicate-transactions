## Duplicate Transactions 

This free App helps you find and merge duplicate transactions in your Bkper Books.

Transactions are sometimes duplicated. This can happen when the one real life transaction is recorded through different sources. For example through your bank as well as credit card company.

## This is how it works

Access Duplicate Transactions from the **context menu** (more) in your book.

1. **Set the criteria:** Specify a **date range** and choose which details (date, amount, accounts, or description) to compare for finding duplicates.
2. **Exclude words:** Optionally enter words to exclude from duplicate detection. Use comma-separated values for OR logic (e.g., "bank, wire" excludes transactions containing either "bank" OR "wire"). Words with spaces are treated as single phrases.
3. **Automatic identification:** The app scans your transactions based on your selections and **tags potential duplicates with #hashtags**.
4. **Easy review:** Each potential duplicate is marked with a **#possibleduplicate** hashtag in the description. Clicking it reveals a list of all potentially matching transactions based on your criteria.
5. **Identify Duplicates**: Multiple Transactions considered to be the repeated are marked with a unique hashtag **#dup_1234567890**. Clicking it reveals the supposedly repeated transactions. 
6. **Merge duplicates:** Once you confirm a pair of transactions as duplicates, you can easily [merge](https://help.bkper.com/en/articles/2667277-merge-transactions) them into a single, accurate entry.
7. **Remove Hashtags:** After merging duplicates, you can remove the hashtags from the app to keep **clean and organized records**.
